# Binary to Decimal Simulator

This project is an enhanced version of the [Binary Coded Decimal 7 Segment Display Decoder (BCD7SDD)](https://github.com/propjockey/bcd7sdd) by [propjockey](https://github.com/propjockey). The original project implements a BCD 7 Segment Display Decoder using CSS with the **Space Toggle trick**. My version includes additional UI changes to improve the appearance and user experience.

## Live Demo

You can view a live version of this project here: [Binary to Decimal Simulator](https://mohammedusmanegani.github.io/Binary-to-Decimal-Simulator/)

## About the Project

This simulator uses a CSS-only technique to display a decimal number from a binary-coded decimal (BCD) input on a 7-segment display. The visual representation showcases how binary values correspond to each digit in the decimal system, making it a useful educational tool.

## Modifications and Enhancements

Building on the original project, this version includes:
- **UI Enhancements**: Updated styling and layout for a more modern and visually engaging design.
- **Improved User Experience**: Adjusted colors, fonts, and spacing to make the interface more readable.

## How It Works

The project uses the **Space Toggle trick** in CSS to turn segments on and off, displaying the correct numbers without relying on JavaScript. The decoder takes BCD inputs and represents them on a 7-segment display, allowing users to see how binary translates to decimal digits.
